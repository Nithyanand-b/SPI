# SPI Controller (Verilog)

This project implements a robust and modular **SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Controller** in Verilog. It supports both read and write operations with proper protocol handling using a finite state machine (FSM).

> **Description**:  
> This shows how the SPI controller interacts with internal data/address registers, the FSM controller, and the MOSI/MISO interface. Core control signals include `clk`, `rst_n`, `write_en`, `addr`, `data_in`, `data_out`, `done`, and `error`.

## âœ… Verification Output Results

The SPI controller was successfully verified using a UVM-based testbench. Below are the validated scenarios and observed outcomes:
